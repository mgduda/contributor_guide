Committing Changes
##################

After you've written code or modified existing code, you'll need to
commit those modifications to the branch that you've created.

Writing Commit Messages

Commit Granularity
******************

Should you commit 10,000 lines of changes across 15 source files all
in the same commit? Probably not.
